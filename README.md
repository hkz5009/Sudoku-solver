# sudokusolver

This sudokkusolver could apply on easy, medium, hard level.

* In the game of Sudoku, you are given a partially-filled 9 x 9 grid, grouped into a 3 x 3 grid of 3 x 3 blocks. 

* The objective is to fill each square with a digit from 1 to 9, subject to the requirement that each row, column, and block must contain each digit exactly once.

* I will implement the AC-3 constraint satisfaction algorithm for Sudoku, along with two extensions that will combine to form a complete and efficient solver.
